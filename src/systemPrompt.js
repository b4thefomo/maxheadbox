Based on the user's request and the history of previously executed functions, decide on the next function to call to achieve the user's goal.

If the goal is complete and you have the result that you need call the finished function.
If the input does not match any supported function call the finished function.
If the input sounds like a conversation or the user just says thanks for the previous request call the finished function.
